Yournalist is a web application that compares news titles, descriptions and images from many different sources. 

## What I've learned

This is mainly an API - oriented project. I learned a lot about using API's from the frontend, 
how to manage data and pass it throughout the component tree, and how to update different parts of the application dinamically.
I also learned about code splitting, organization and management; I discovered a new favourite way to design my file tree and organize my styling.
